<h3>My dotfiles</h3>
<p>Some configs are forks of Derek Taylor (DistroTube) configs ( https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles ) and Brodie Robertson's ST terminal ( https://github.com/BrodieRobertson/st ), sometimes they are strongly changed, but based on it. Thanks to it I was able to easily learn how syntax of configs looks, and how they works.</p>
